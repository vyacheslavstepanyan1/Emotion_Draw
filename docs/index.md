## **Our Vision!** 🌟

***Bringing Emotions to Canvas!***

🏆 Our mission is to craft an interactive web application that transforms text inputs into captivating visual representations of emotions.

## **How We Do It? 🤔**

***The Art of Emotion Extraction!***

📊 **Data Dive:** We utilize the Emotions dataset designed for NLP tasks from Kaggle. Dive into it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp?resource=download). 

🧠 **Model Magic:** Fine-tuning a BERT-based model (e.g., ALBERT) on this dataset, we train it to perceive emotions, treating it as a classification puzzle.

💡 **Emotion Elixir:** Using our trained model, we distill emotions from user-provided sentences, turning text into raw emotional data.

🌅 **Prompt Poetry:** With these emotions in hand, we weave them into prompts fit for our stable diffusion model, the very brushstrokes of our artistic endeavor.

🎆 **Image Illumination:** Let the magic unfold! Our stable diffusion model paints abstract visual masterpieces, inspired by Spiritualist art, capturing the essence of emotion.

🚀 **API Alchemy:** Constructing a stable diffusion API with FastAPI, bridging the gap between frontend and backend.

🖼️ **Frontend Flourish:** Our user-friendly interface, crafted with JavaScript React, invites you to create your own masterpieces.

## **Why Emotion Draw? 🎭**

***Artistry meets Technology!***

📌 **Emotion Unveiling:** Our BERT-based model uncovers emotions, even amidst the complexity of mixed feelings or unclear emotional states. It delves into the nuances, capturing the essence of human sentiment, even when individuals are solely focused on situational details rather than their emotional state.

📌 **Abstract Expressionism:** We focus on capturing the essence of emotions, transcending mere words and delving into the realm of abstract art.

📌 **Creative Freedom:** Rather than taking user sentences as they are, we predict and depict emotions, opening doors to infinite artistic possibilities.
